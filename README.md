Early Python practice and learning experiments
# Python Basics

This repository contains small Python exercises and experiments as I learn programming.

## First Practice
- Used `input()` to collect user input
- Used f-strings for formatted output
- Learned that Python is case-sensitive (`print` vs `Print`)
## Simple Calculator

Built a basic calculator using user input.
- Practiced converting strings to integers with `int()`
- Learned to avoid redundant type casting
- Reinforced input → process → output structure

## Goal
Build a strong foundation in Python and document my learning process.
