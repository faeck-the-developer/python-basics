# Please write a program which asks the user for two numbers. The program will then print out the sum and the product of the two numbers. The program should function as follows:
Number 1: 3
Number 2: 7
The sum of the numbers: 10
The product of the numbers: 21

num1 = int(input ("Number 1: "))
num2 = int(input ("Number 2: "))
result = num1 + num2
result2 = num1 * num2
print (f"The sum of the numbers: {result}")
print (f"The product of the numbers: {result2}")
